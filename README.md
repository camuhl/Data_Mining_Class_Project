# Data_Mining_Class_Project

This project was a class project I created in a graduate level data mining class I took in my junior year of college. It's was to showcase data mining techniques learned in the class by acurately predicting the selection of NBA all-stars via boxscore statistics. Ultimatly the model preformed comparibly to articles from media personalities from the time. Unfortunantly, I have since lost the data sources for the project but I have included the text file of the R markdown code and the final PDF for the project here for archival purposes.
